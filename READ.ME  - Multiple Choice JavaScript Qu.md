READ.ME  - Multiple Choice JavaScript Quiz

Procedure

    1. Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

    2. I created the format of the HTML file and created buttons that would be later identified by the JS file.

    3. I then created the style of the page using CSS attributes, pulling elements identified in the HTML doc.

    4. In the JS file, I first created the questions for the quiz.

    5. In the JS file I identified the variables from the HTML doc that were to be manipulated in the JS file.

    6. I then created the timer as well as the various functions for the questions, adding click functions for them.

    7. I also created a login form for the users to store their information after taking the quiz to store their results


Difficulties I faced

    1. I struggled getting the timer to stop at 0, I scoured Google and YouTube for helpful resources but to no avail.

    2. I could not figure out how to properly store user information so that they could view their score in the console, once again I used my resources of Google and YouTube but to no avail.


Overview

    Overall this project was very difficult for me to say the least. I wish I'd spent more time on it to get it to properly function and display correctly. I feel like I was so close to getting it to perfection but was caught by time.
